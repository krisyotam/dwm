# Kris's build of dwm

## FAQ

> What are the bindings?

This is suckless, mmmbud, the source code is the documentation! Check out [config.h](config.h).

## Installation for newbs

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krisyotam/dwm.git
cd dwm
sudo make install
```

There is also a `PKGBUILD` usable on distributions with pacman. Run `makepkg -si` instead of `sudo make install`.
